#For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. //  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equinxx/spotify-top-50-songs-in-2021?select=spotify_top50_2021.csv  //
# And performed analytics on the data using SQL.

  1. Top 10 songs.
    SELECT artist_name, track_name FROM Spotifydata
      ORDER BY popularity desc
      LIMIT 10;

   2. Most popular artist by how many of their songs are in the top 50
    SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name) FROM Spotifydata
      GROUP BY artist_name
      ORDER BY COUNT(artist_name) desc;
